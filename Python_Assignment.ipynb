    "#Answer: Features in Python\n",
    "## 1. Free and Open Source\n",
    "#Python language is freely available at the official website and it is open-source, this means that source code is also                                                                                                                     \n",
    "#available to the public. So you can download it, use it as well as share it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Easy to code\n",
    "#Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages \n",
    "#like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics \n",
    "#in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Easy to Read\n",
    "#As you will see, learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Pythonâ€™s syntax is really straightforward.\n",
    "#The code block is defined by the indentations rather than by semicolons or brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. High-Level Language\n",
    "#Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in Python, we do not need to remember the system architecture,\n",
    "#nor do we need to manage the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Large Community Support\n",
    "#Python has gained popularity over the years. Our questions are constantly answered by the enormous StackOverflow community.\n",
    "# These websites have already provided answers to many questions about Python, so Python users can consult them as needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 6. Large Standard Library \n",
    "#Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own\n",
    "#code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in Python such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web\n",
    "#browsers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.  Allocating Memory Dynamically\n",
    "#In Python, the variable data type does not need to be specified. The memory is automatically allocated to a variable at \n",
    "#runtime when it is given a value. Developers do not need to write int y = 18 if the integer value 15 is set to y. You \n",
    "#may just type y=18.\n"

    "##Python Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in Python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define\n",
    "#the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name.In Python, there is an \n",
    "#inbuilt keyword module that provides an iskeyword() function that can be used to check whether a given string is a valid\n",

    "\n",
    "#List of Python Keywords:\n",
    "# 1.True, False- They both are used in logical expressions and represent the boolean values 'True' and ' False'.\n",
    "# 2.None- It is used to represent that there is no value or it is null.\n",
    "# 3.and-It will return 'True' when both the operands are 'True'.\n",
    "# 4.or-It will return 'True' when at least one of the operand is 'True'.\n",
    "# 5.not-It will return the opposite of the operand.\n",
    "# 6.in-It checks that whether a specified value is present in the given sequence.\n",
    "# 7.is-It compares the identity of objects.>>(==)Symbol\n",
    "# 8.if-It will execute a code block if the condition is 'True'.\n",
    "# 9.elif-It is the short form of 'else if'. It will put another alternative condition for checking if the 'if' condition is 'False'.\n",
    "# 10.else-It will execute a code block if none of the conditions are 'True'.\n",
    "# 11.for-It iterates over the elements of a specified sequence.\n",
    "# 12.while-It will execute a code block as long as the condition is 'True'.\n",
    "# 13.break-It is used for terminating the loop before completion.\n",
    "# 14.continue-It is used for skipping the current iteration and continue with the next one.\n",
    "# 15.else-It will execute a code block when the has completed without a 'break' statement.\n",

    "## Examples Of Keywords:\n",

    "print(True)# 1 is the value of True.\n",
    "print(False)# 0 is the value of False.\n",
